How to properly build the project:
While you are in the root directory of the project issue following commands:

> mkdir build
> cd build
# Provide your device architecture (ie. sm_13 - GT200, sm_20 - GF100)
> cmake -D CUDA_ARCH:STRING=sm_? ..
> make

There should be brand new shared library in the build directory.

To build sample applications:
> cd apps
> mkdir build
> cmake ..
> make
